## Title  
AI Agent Demo ‚Äì Smart Lead Engagement & CRM Enrichment

## Prepared For  
Interview demonstration for an AI automation role involving CRM, LLM agents, and business operations automation.

---

## 1. Objective

Build a demo-ready AI agent that automates lead follow-ups, simulates multi-turn conversations, and updates a CRM with contextually enriched information such as interaction history, inferred lead priority, and recommended next steps.

This demo should:
- Demonstrate agentic reasoning with memory.
- Highlight CRM integration (mocked).
- Show how to scale memory and task chaining in real-world use.
- Simulate multiple leads and multiple back-and-forth conversations.

---

## 2. Scope & Constraints

- ‚ùå No real API access to Zoho, Gmail, or Pinecone.
- ‚úÖ Everything must be simulated or mocked.
- ‚è± Time constraint: 20 hours.
- üéØ Target audience: Interviewers evaluating AI agentic system design, implementation fluency, and product thinking.

## 6. Data Models

### Lead (from CRM)
```json
{
  "id": "lead_001",
  "name": "Alice",
  "email": "alice@acme.com",
  "company": "Acme Corp",
  "interests": "dashboards, marketing automation",
  "status": "new",
  "interaction_history": [],
  "inferred_priority": null,
  "recommended_action": null
}
```

### Conversation Turn
```json
{
  "agent": "Hi Alice, I saw you're interested in dashboards...",
  "lead": "Yes, we're exploring some tools."
}
```

## 7. Implementation Order

| Phase | Task                                                                 |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0     | Scaffold repo: create CRM mock, config, and setup                    |

- [x] Run 5-turn exchanges for each flow
- [x] Log conversation history

### ‚úÖ EPIC 5: CRM Updates & Enrichment

- ‚úÖ Each lead has 5-turn back-and-forths
- ‚úÖ Output includes memory usage, updated CRM, and actionable insight
- ‚úÖ You can walk through how this design scales with real APIs and vector memory
