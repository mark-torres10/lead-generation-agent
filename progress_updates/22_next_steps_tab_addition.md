# 22. Next Steps Tab Addition (2024-06-07)

## Summary
- Added a new "Next Steps for Productionization" tab to the Leads AI Agent Demo UI.
- The tab presents a prioritized roadmap for taking the demo to production, with actionable items and business value for each area.

## Implementation Details
- Created `ui/tabs/next_steps_tab.py` with a static presentation of key next steps using Streamlit, matching the style of the metrics tab.
- Updated `app.py` to import and render the new tab as the last tab in the main app interface (after Metrics and Evaluations).
- The tab is labeled "ðŸš€ Next Steps" and is visible to all users.
- Each section covers: action item, implementation details, and value/unlock for stakeholders.

## Testing
- Manual validation: Launched the app and confirmed the new tab appears as the last tab.
- Verified that all next steps are displayed as intended, with correct section headers and descriptions.
- No live data or calculations are shown yet (static content only).

## Remaining Work
- **Roadmap Implementation:** Begin implementing the next steps as features mature.
- **Visualization:** Add progress indicators or links to related features as they are built.
- **Stakeholder Feedback:** Gather feedback on proposed next steps and adjust as needed.
