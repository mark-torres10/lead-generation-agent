# 21. Metrics & Evaluations Tab Addition (2024-06-07)

## Summary
- Added a new "Metrics and Evaluations" tab to the Leads AI Agent Demo UI.
- The tab presents proposed business impact, technical performance, and quality metrics for future implementation.

## Implementation Details
- Created `ui/tabs/metrics_evals_tab.py` with a static presentation of key metrics and evaluation criteria using Streamlit.
- Updated `app.py` to import and render the new tab as the last tab in the main app interface.
- The tab is labeled "ðŸ“Š Metrics and Evaluations" and is visible to all users.

## Testing
- Manual validation: Launched the app and confirmed the new tab appears as the last tab.
- Verified that all proposed metrics are displayed as intended, with correct section headers and descriptions.
- No live data or calculations are shown yet (static content only).

## Remaining Work
- **Metrics Implementation:** Wire up live data and calculations for each metric as features mature.
- **Visualization:** Add charts or visual summaries for key metrics.
- **Stakeholder Feedback:** Gather feedback on proposed metrics and adjust as needed.
