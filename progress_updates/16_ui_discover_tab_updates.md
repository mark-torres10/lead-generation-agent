# 16. UI Discover New Leads Tab Completion (2025-05-26)

## Summary
- **Discover New Leads Tab:** The Discover New Leads tab is now fully implemented, allowing users to input or select a known contact's email and discover other potential leads at the same company. Users can select a discovered lead, generate and edit a personalized outreach email, and simulate sending itâ€”all with robust error handling and clear UI feedback.
- **Lead Discovery Sources:** Added a section outlining various ways new leads can be discovered, including CC/BCC on emails, meeting attendees, CRM exports, 3rd party integrations, and more.

## Implementation Details
- Created `ui/tabs/discover_tab.py` with all backend and UI logic for the new tab.
- Added 10 dummy leads across different domains, with overlap to demo data for realistic testing.
- Implemented domain extraction and search logic to find leads at the same company.
- Built UI for manual email input, demo email selection, lead selection, and outreach email editing.
- Integrated LLM-based outreach draft generation (with fallback mock for reliability).
- Gracefully handle no-match and error states with user-friendly messages.
- All new code follows `UI_PRINCIPLES.md` and `RULES.md`.

## Testing
- Manual testing of all UI flows: input, discovery, selection, email generation, and submission.
- Verified error handling for invalid emails and no-match scenarios.
- Confirmed that all UI elements update session state as expected.
- (Planned) Integration tests in `tests/test_ui_backend_integration.py` to cover all flows.

## Remaining Work
- **LLM Integration:** Swap mock LLM with production model and validate outputs.
- **Advanced Source Integration:** Add real integrations for CRM, calendar, and 3rd party sources as backend capabilities mature.
- **Analytics & Logging:** Expand logging for outreach actions and user interactions for future analytics.
- **Accessibility:** Review and enhance accessibility and keyboard navigation.
