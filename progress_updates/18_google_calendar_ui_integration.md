# 18. Google Calendar Integration & Meeting Scheduling UI (2025-05-26)

## Summary
- Completed Google Calendar API integration with robust, reusable architecture.
- Refactored UI to allow users to select both day and time for meetings, with real-time slot availability.
- Ensured all invites are sandboxed for safety and no real/fake emails are used.
- Improved user experience for meeting scheduling, preventing double-booking and surfacing errors clearly.

## Implementation Details
- Created `integrations/google/calendar_manager.py` for Google Calendar API access, inheriting from a shared `GoogleAPICore`.
- Refactored all Google API logic into `google_api_core.py` for credential management and service setup.
- Updated UI (`ui/tabs/meeting_tab.py`) to:
  - Always show both day and time dropdowns.
  - Dynamically update available time slots when the day changes.
  - Disable the time dropdown if no slots are available, but keep it visible.
  - Only enable the "Schedule Meeting" button when a valid slot is selected.
- All calendar event attendee lists are validated to only use the sandbox email.
- Improved error handling and user feedback for calendar API errors.

## Testing
- Manual testing of the meeting scheduling UI for all edge cases:
  - Changing days updates time slots in real time.
  - Disabled state for time dropdown when no slots are available.
  - Button only enabled when a valid slot is selected.
  - No real/fake emails receive invites; only sandbox email is used.
- Verified that all Google Calendar API calls succeed and no 400 errors occur.
- Unit and integration tests for `CalendarManager` and related logic.

## Remaining Work
- None for this phase. All planned backend and UI/UX improvements for Google Calendar integration are complete.
