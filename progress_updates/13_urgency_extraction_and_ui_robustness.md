## Title
UI Robustness & Accurate Urgency Extraction for Lead Qualification

## Summary
- Fixed a critical issue where the urgency field was not being extracted from LLM output, even when present in the prompt and user message.
- Updated the backend parser to always extract 'urgency' from the LLM response by including it in the expected fields.
- Enhanced the prompt template to require 'Urgency' as a top-level output field, with clear instructions and examples for the LLM.
- Verified that urgency is now correctly set to 'high' for messages with clear urgency cues (e.g., "wrapped up in 4-6 weeks").
- All UI-backend integration and agent unit tests pass, confirming robust handling of urgency and other fields.
- Checked off completed tasks in the UI Qualification Results Enhancement Plan.

## Details
- The LLM prompt now explicitly requires 'Urgency' in the output format, and the parser extracts it reliably.
- The UI now displays the correct urgency value, and fallback logic is robust for missing or minimal data.
- Added/extended tests to ensure:
    - Form submission uses user-edited values
    - Clearing results is robust
    - Urgency fallback logic is correct
- All changes are tracked in the planning markdown for future changelog generation.

## Next Steps
- Continue UI/UX polish for signals/factors and confidence improvements.
- Expand CRM before/after and timeline features.
- Address Pydantic v2 deprecation warnings in future refactors.
