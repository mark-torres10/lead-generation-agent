# 15. UI Meeting Tab Updates (2025-05-26)

## Summary
- **Lead ID Handling:** The meeting tab now uses `memory_manager.get_or_create_lead_id(lead_email, lead_data)` for all meeting requests. This ensures that repeated meetings for the same lead use a consistent lead ID, preventing CRM fragmentation and enabling accurate history tracking.
- **Persistent Interaction History:** Every meeting scheduling action is now logged as a `meeting_scheduled` interaction. The interaction history for each lead now accurately reflects all meetings scheduled, and this is shown in the UI timeline/history.

## Implementation Details
- Refactored `process_meeting_scheduling_demo` to log a `meeting_scheduled` interaction for each meeting.
- Updated/extended integration test (`test_meeting_tab_lead_id_handling`) to verify:
  - The same lead ID is used for repeated meetings with the same email.
  - The interaction history for the lead accumulates all meetings.
- All tests pass, confirming correct behavior.

## Testing
- Ran integration test: `test_meeting_tab_lead_id_handling`.
- Verified that:
  - The same lead ID is returned for repeated meetings.
  - The interaction history contains an entry for each meeting scheduled.

## Remaining Work
- **CRM Before/After Display:** Add side-by-side before/after CRM record display for transparency and user trust.
- **Model/Dict Result Robustness:** Update UI logic to handle both dict and model results, converting as needed to prevent `AttributeError` or `KeyError`.
- **Explainability & Confidence:** Add display of signals/factors and confidence improvement suggestions, following the pattern in other tabs.
- **Form Submission Robustness:** Use a Streamlit form to ensure the latest user-edited values are submitted, not just sample or default values.
- **Clear Results Button Robustness:** Make clear/reset logic robust to all result types and missing fields, preventing exceptions or incomplete resets.
