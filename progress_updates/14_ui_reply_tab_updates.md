## Title
UI Reply Tab: Robustness, Intent Mapping, and Qualification History Improvements

## Summary
- Fixed intent mapping logic to correctly classify negative replies (e.g., "not interested") and prevent substring misclassification.
- Updated the qualification history UI so each expander only shows the reply analysis relevant to that specific event.
- Ensured the reply tab uses a persistent database for session consistency.
- Improved form reset logic for analyzing multiple replies for the same user.
- Added/extended unit and integration tests for all new and fixed logic.
- All changes are tracked in the planning markdown and verified by passing tests.

## Details
- **Intent Mapping:** The `determine_demo_intent` function now checks for negative/edge cases before positive substrings, ensuring correct classification of replies.
- **Qualification History Filtering:** Each expander in the qualification history now displays only the reply analysis for that specific qualification event, eliminating repeated or global history.
- **Persistent DB:** The reply tab now uses a persistent database file for the session, so qualification and reply analysis are consistent across tabs and browser refreshes.
- **Form Reset:** The form resets when a new sample reply is selected, allowing multiple analyses for the same user without stale data.
- **Robust Model/Dict Handling:** The UI can now handle both dict and model results for reply analysis, preventing attribute errors.
- **Test Coverage:** Added/extended unit tests for intent mapping, mock response generation, and UI-backend integration. All tests pass in the correct conda environment.

## Next Steps
- Continue UI/UX polish for reply analysis and qualification history.
- Expand CRM before/after and timeline features as needed.
- Address Pydantic v2 deprecation warnings in future refactors.
