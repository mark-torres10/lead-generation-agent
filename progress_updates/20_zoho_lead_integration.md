# 20. Zoho CRM Lead Integration & Automated Token Refresh (2024-06-07)

## Summary
- Implemented direct Zoho CRM lead creation from the qualification UI tab.
- Replaced unreliable SDK with robust requests-based integration.
- Automated OAuth2 access token refresh for seamless API usage.
- Ensured user feedback in the UI for Zoho lead creation success/failure.

## Implementation Details
- Added `integrations/zoho_manager.py`:
  - Uses the `requests` library for all Zoho CRM API calls (SDK was not reliable).
  - Loads config and credentials from `zoho_config.json` or environment variables.
  - Implements `create_lead(data: dict)` for creating leads in Zoho CRM.
  - Automates access token refresh using `refresh_token`, `client_id`, and `client_secret`.
  - Optionally updates the config file with the latest access token.
  - Logs and raises errors for all API failures.
- Updated `ui/tabs/qualify_tab.py`:
  - On form submission, calls `ZohoManager.create_lead()` with form data and `source` set to "Qualification Inbound".
  - Displays a clear success or error message in the UI based on the Zoho API response.
- All authentication/config is loaded securely (never hardcoded).
- Added/updated tests to mock Zoho API calls and verify correct data is sent.

## Testing
- Manual testing of the qualification UI:
  - Submitted multiple leads and verified their creation in Zoho CRM.
  - Confirmed that the "source" field is set to "Qualification Inbound".
  - Verified UI feedback for both success and error cases.
- Automated tests for `ZohoManager` (with API mocking):
  - Token refresh logic.
  - Error handling for invalid tokens and API failures.
- Confirmed that no SDK dependencies remain and all API calls use requests.

## Remaining Work
- **Docs:** Update `integrations/README.md` with Zoho integration usage and configuration details.
- **Production:** Consider using a secrets manager for access tokens in production.
- None at this time for code or integration.
