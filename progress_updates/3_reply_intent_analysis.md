   Sentiment: positive
   Urgency: high
   Next Action: Schedule a call with Alice as soon as possible to discuss her needs and budget
   Follow-up Timing: immediate
   Reasoning: Alice's email reply clearly indicates strong interest with explicit mention of budget approval and decision timeline...
```

**Polite Decline:**
```
üéØ Analysis Results:
   Disposition: maybe
   Confidence: 60%
   Sentiment: neutral
   Urgency: low
   Next Action: Schedule a follow-up reminder for Q2 next year and send relevant content in the meantime
   Follow-up Timing: 3-months
   Reasoning: Polite but clear indication of no current need, with specific timeline mentioned for future consideration...
```
