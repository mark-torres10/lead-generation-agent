# UI Meeting Tab Bug Fix & Enhancement Plan

## Planned Fixes & Improvements

1. **Lead ID Handling:** ✅ Implemented. All meeting requests now use `memory_manager.get_or_create_lead_id(lead_email, lead_data)` to ensure consistent lead IDs and CRM history. Verified by integration test.
2. **Return Value Consistency:** In progress. Consider refactoring `process_meeting_scheduling_demo` to always return a model or ensure dicts are converted for UI safety and attribute access.
3. **Persistent Interaction History:** ✅ Implemented. All meeting scheduling actions are now logged as persistent interactions and shown in the timeline/history. Verified by integration test.
4. **CRM Before/After Display:** Not yet implemented. Add side-by-side before/after CRM record display for transparency and user trust.
5. **Robustness to Model/Dict Results:** Not yet implemented. Update UI logic to handle both dict and model results, converting as needed to prevent `AttributeError` or `KeyError`.
6. **Explainability & Confidence:** Not yet implemented. Add display of signals/factors and confidence improvement suggestions, following the pattern in other tabs.
7. **Form Submission Robustness:** Not yet implemented. Use a Streamlit form to ensure the latest user-edited values are submitted, not just sample or default values.
8. **Clear Results Button Robustness:** Not yet implemented. Make clear/reset logic robust to all result types and missing fields, preventing exceptions or incomplete resets.
9. **Test Coverage:** ✅ Extended. Integration test now covers lead ID consistency and interaction history for repeated meetings.

## Bug Fixes

### Problem
- Previously, repeated meetings for the same lead could create multiple lead IDs and did not accumulate interaction history.

### Solution
- Refactored meeting tab logic to use email-based lead ID lookup/creation and log all meeting scheduling actions as interactions.
- Added/extended integration test to verify correct behavior.

### Implementation Checklist
- [x] Use `get_or_create_lead_id` for all meeting requests
- [x] Log each meeting as an interaction
- [x] Test: repeated meetings for same lead use same lead ID and accumulate history
- [ ] CRM before/after display
- [ ] Model/dict result robustness
- [ ] Form and clear/reset robustness
- [ ] Explainability/confidence display

## Enhancement & Feature Plan

### Problem
- Some UI/UX and robustness features are still missing (see above).

### Solution
- Continue with checklist above.

### Implementation Checklist

## Additional Updates (2025-05)
- Lead ID and interaction history logic for meetings is now robust and tested.
