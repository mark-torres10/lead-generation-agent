# Leads AI Agent Demo

## What is This?

This demo shows how an AI agent can automate the most time-consuming parts of lead generation and management for your business. It is designed for business owners and sales leaders who want to see, in a simple and interactive way, how AI can:

- Qualify new leads automatically
- Analyze and respond to customer emails
- Schedule meetings without manual back-and-forth
- Keep your CRM up to date, without extra work

## Built-in Integrations

This demo automatically connects with popular business tools to save you even more time:

- **Zoho CRM:** New leads and updates are pushed directly to your CRM, so your records are always current—no manual entry needed.
- **Slack:** Get instant notifications about new leads, replies, or meetings right in your team's Slack channels.
- **Google Calendar:** Meetings are scheduled and added to your calendar automatically, reducing back-and-forth and missed appointments.
- **Gmail:** Follow-up and confirmation emails are sent on your behalf, ensuring fast, professional communication with every lead.

## What Problems Does It Solve?

- **Wasted Time on Unqualified Leads:** The AI reviews new inquiries and tells you which are worth your attention.
- **Slow Follow-Ups:** It drafts and sends personalized follow-up emails instantly, so you never miss an opportunity.
- **Missed Meetings:** It handles meeting requests and finds the best time, reducing no-shows and lost leads.

## How Does the Demo Work?

The demo is a simple web app with four main sections:

1. **Lead Qualification**
   - Fill out a sample contact form or use quick-fill buttons.
   - The AI reviews the lead, scores it, and shows you a ready-to-send follow-up email.
   - See before/after CRM records and the AI's reasoning.

2. **Reply Analysis**
   - Paste in a customer reply or use sample replies.
   - The AI figures out what the customer wants (interested, needs info, wants a meeting, not interested) and drafts a response.
   - CRM is updated with the latest status.

3. **Meeting Scheduling**
   - Enter meeting details or pick a scenario (like "Product Demo").
   - The AI finds a time, creates a calendar invite, and sends a confirmation email.
   - All details are logged in the CRM.

4. **Metrics & Next Steps**
   - See what business results you can expect (conversion rates, response times, etc.).
   - View a clear roadmap for taking this from demo to production in your business.
